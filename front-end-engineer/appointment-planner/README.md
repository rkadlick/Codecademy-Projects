## Project Overview

This project is part of the Front-End Development track and is more open-ended than typical projects. You will use React to build an application that manages contacts and appointments. The project challenges you to build the app using functional components and manage state with React hooks. It consists of two pages: one for managing contacts and another for managing appointments.

## Project Goals

1. **Create a Contact Management App**
   * Build a page where users can add, view, and manage contacts.
   * Store each contact's name, phone number, and email.
   * Ensure that contacts can be edited and deleted as necessary.

2. **Create an Appointment Management App**
   * Build a second page where users can add, view, and manage appointments.
   * Each appointment will need to track a title, contact (from the contact list), date, and time.
   * Allow users to create, view, and delete appointments.

3. **Use React Functional Components**
   * The entire application will be built using functional React components.
   * Manage component state with React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.

4. **Component Breakdown**
   * You will work from the top-most components down, implementing stateful components and then smaller, stateless components.
   * You can follow the recommended component hierarchy in the requirements or choose a different approach if it better suits your workflow.

5. **My Project**
   * My [project](https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects/tree/main/front-end-development/appointment-planner) enables users to organize their contacts and appointments efficiently, with intuitive UI for adding, viewing, and managing both contacts and appointments.

## Built With
* React
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* CSS (for styling)
