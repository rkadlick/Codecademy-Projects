## Project Overview

This project differs from others you’ve encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project consists of open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. You’ll be creating your own basic design system for a website, which will help streamline the process of building websites in the future. The design system will include elements like colors, fonts, and common styles.

## Project Goals

1. **Project Context**
   * For this project, you’ll be developing a design system that consolidates the colors, fonts, and repeating styles you plan to use across various websites. This will act as a foundation for future web development projects, enabling more efficient and consistent designs.

2. **Project Objectives**
   * Build a basic design system using HTML and CSS
   * Collect and structure your site’s colors, fonts, and reusable styles
   * Develop locally on your computer or using Codecademy’s platform

3. **My Project**
   * My [project](https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects/tree/main/front-end-engineer/website-design-system) showcases a personal design system that incorporates core design elements like typography, color schemes, and standardized components. The design system helps streamline website creation and ensures visual consistency across multiple projects.

4. **Output Example**
   * A structured design system website containing color palettes, font styles, and reusable styles like buttons and input fields.
