## Project Overview

In this project, you will fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. You will be provided with specs to help guide you in making adjustments to the broken code. The goal is to use your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Chrome DevTools to troubleshoot and fix the site.

As you fix Fotomatic’s bugs, remember to use the skills you acquired in the Chrome DevTools article to help you decipher and update the site’s CSS. Chrome DevTools are essential for debugging – they allow you to view current style values, toggle rules, and test different rule values.
