## Project Overview

This project differs from others you’ve encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project consists of open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. You’ll be creating your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future. This personalized reference will serve as a handy resource for HTML, CSS, and web development.

## Project Goals

1. **Project Context**
   * For this project, you’ll be designing and building a custom cheat sheet that you can refer to in future web development projects. By consolidating your notes and key concepts, you’ll create a go-to reference guide that’s tailored to your needs as a developer.

2. **Project Objectives**
   * Build a personalized HTML & CSS reference cheat sheet
   * Include key concepts, tags, and properties that will help in future web development projects
   * Develop locally on your computer or using Codecademy’s platform

3. **My Project**
   * My [project](https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects/tree/main/front-end-engineer/cheat-sheet) showcases a reference cheat sheet with essential HTML tags, CSS properties, and layout techniques. It’s designed to help streamline future web development projects by providing quick access to commonly used elements and styles.

4. **Output Example**
   * A structured webpage containing a list of essential HTML tags, CSS properties, and web development tips, organized for easy reference.
