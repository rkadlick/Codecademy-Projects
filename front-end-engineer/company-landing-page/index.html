		  <h3>Clingstone Peach</h3>
		  <p>At the start of the season, we harvest clingstone peaches, a set of varieties that is descriptively named for the fruit that is attached to the stone or pit of the peach. These peaches are perfect for eating fresh. They’re typically smaller, juicy and sweet, and are ideal for getting peach season off to a fresh start. </p>

		  <h3>Semi-clingstone Peach</h3>
		  <p>These midseason peaches have some characteristics of both clingstone and freestone categories. They combine the sweetness of clingstone peaches with the easiness of freestones for a less frequent but highly desirable type of peach. These varieties are mostly only available to harvest during the later part of the month of May, but are fitting for peach canning projects so that you can enjoy them long into the summer and fall.</p>

		  <h3>Freestone Peach</h3>
		  <p>As you’d expect, freestone peaches are not attached to the pits, which helps them fall easily off of it as you’re slicing open your summer fruit. Typically larger than clingstone peaches, freestones are best eaten fresh and are popular in markets and grocery stores mid-summer. </p>

		  <h3>Heirloom Peach</h3>
		  <p>Mid- to late season, heirloom peaches make their debut with popular varieties that have been established for more than 50 years. These are the peaches we grew up picking, packing and enjoying and the peaches the locals wait for. These peaches take us back to lazy afternoons spent on porch swings listening to our daddies’ gentle laughter as they told stories and churned homemade peach ice cream. Most of these varieties aren’t shipped and are only available in our store. </p>
