## Project Overview

This project differs from others you’ve encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project consists of open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. You’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage. You can choose to create a homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company!
