## Project Overview

This project differs from others you’ve encountered on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains open-ended requirements describing the game you’ll be building. You’ll use your knowledge of JavaScript functions to create a small guessing game. While many ways exist to fulfill the requirements, the focus is on using resources, including Codecademy and the internet, to solve any problems encountered.

To complete this project, you should have completed the first three sections of **Introduction to JavaScript**.

## Project Goals

1. **Project Context**
   * In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small number guessing game. The game will be played in the browser, and your JavaScript functions will interact with HTML and CSS code.

2. **Project Objectives**
   * Write four JavaScript functions that are called by the provided game logic.
   * Ensure that your functions are named exactly as specified so that they can interact properly with the game.
   * Test and debug your code using the browser console to ensure that the game works as expected.

3. **My Project**
   * My [project](https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects/tree/main/back-end-engineer/number-guesser) contains the implementation of the number guessing game, where the user interacts with the browser to guess numbers based on randomly generated targets.

4. **Output Example**
   * A browser-based number guessing game where users can input guesses and receive feedback. The game logic is powered by JavaScript functions written in `script.js`.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   * You can clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file.
   * To clone the repository, run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects.git
     ```
   * To download as a ZIP file, click the “Code” button on the GitHub page and select “Download ZIP.”

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   * Open the project folder on your computer, under Codecademy-Projects/back-end-engineer/number-guesser.

3. **Edit and Run the Game**
   * Open `script.js` in your preferred text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
   * Open `index.html` in your browser to run the game and test your functions.
   * Use your browser's developer tools console to test and debug your code.

4. **Testing and Debugging**
   * Test your code by playing the game in the browser. Make sure all functions are working correctly based on user interactions.
