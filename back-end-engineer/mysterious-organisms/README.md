## Project Overview

This project differs from others you’ve encountered on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, it provides open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. You’ll simulate the DNA of a newly discovered organism called **Pila aequor**. There are many ways to fulfill the requirements, so expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources to solve any problems you encounter.

## Project Goals

1. **Project Context**
   * You are part of a research team studying a mysterious organism called **Pila aequor (P. aequor)**, which resides deep in the ocean near hydrothermal vents. P. aequor is unique due to its small DNA size, consisting of only 15 bases, and its high mutation frequency. However, the organism is difficult to locate and study due to its deep-sea habitat.
   * Your task is to create JavaScript objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor so your team can study it without having to dive into the ocean.

2. **Project Objectives**
   * Write JavaScript functions and objects to simulate P. aequor’s DNA.
   * Check the behavior of your code using the terminal and `console.log()` statements.
   * Implement object-oriented programming concepts to represent DNA samples.

3. **My Project**
   * My [project](https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects/tree/main/back-end-engineer/mysterious-organism) contains the implementation of objects and functions that simulate P. aequor’s DNA. This simulation allows researchers to analyze the organism's mutations and behavior using JavaScript.

4. **Output Example**
   * A set of DNA samples represented as JavaScript objects, with functions that allow for mutation, comparison, and analysis of different DNA sequences.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   * You can clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file.
   * To clone the repository, run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects.git
     ```
   * To download as a ZIP file, click the “Code” button on the GitHub page and select “Download ZIP.”

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   * Open the project folder on your computer, under Codecademy-Projects/back-end-engineer/mysterious-organism.

3. **Install Node.js**
   * If you haven’t installed Node.js on your machine, follow [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install it.

4. **Open and Run the Project**
   * Open `main.js` in your preferred text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
   * Run the project by executing the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     node main.js
     ```
   * Use `console.log()` statements to test the output of your functions and verify the simulation's behavior.

5. **Testing and Debugging**
   * Test your code using Node.js in the terminal. Check for mutations, DNA comparisons, and other functions that simulate the organism’s behavior.
