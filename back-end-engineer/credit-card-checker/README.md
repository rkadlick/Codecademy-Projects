## Project Overview

This project differs from others you’ve encountered on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, it provides open-ended requirements that describe the project you’ll be building. Your goal is to create a program that checks whether credit card numbers are valid, automating a task that other clerks do by hand.

## Project Goals

1. **Project Context**
   * You work for a company that suspects credit card distributors have been issuing invalid numbers. As a clerk, your task is to validate multiple credit card numbers at once using a program. This will save time and effort compared to the manual verification process that other clerks use.
   * The project requires writing JavaScript functions and loops to check the validity of credit card numbers and handle batches of cards efficiently.

2. **Project Objectives**
   * Create functions that validate credit card numbers based on specified rules.
   * Implement loops to handle multiple card numbers in a batch.
   * Use the terminal and `console.log()` to verify the correctness of your code.

3. **My Project**
   * My [project](https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects/tree/main/back-end-engineer/credit-card-checker) provides an automated solution for verifying credit card numbers. It allows for batch processing of cards, using JavaScript functions to determine the validity of each card based on provided criteria.

4. **Output Example**
   * A set of validated credit card numbers, with invalid numbers flagged for further action. The output is generated based on the validation rules and is displayed via `console.log()` statements.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   * You can clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file.
   * To clone the repository, run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/rkadlick/Codecademy-Projects.git
     ```
   * To download as a ZIP file, click the “Code” button on the GitHub page and select “Download ZIP.”

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   * Open the project folder on your computer, under Codecademy-Projects/back-end-engineer/credit-card-checker.

3. **Install Node.js**
   * If you haven’t installed Node.js on your machine, follow [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install it.

4. **Open and Run the Project**
   * Open `main.js` in your preferred text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text).
   * Run the project by executing the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     node main.js
     ```
   * Use `console.log()` statements to test the output of your validation functions and ensure they are working correctly.

5. **Testing and Debugging**
   * Test your code using Node.js in the terminal. Validate various credit card numbers and review the output to ensure all validation rules are correctly applied.
